# Image2ASCII

This project is a Python program that converts images into ASCII art.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (installed via `pip install Pillow`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Image2ASCII.git
```


2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ascii-art-converter
```


3. Install Pillow library:

Ensure you have pip installed. If you don't have pip installed, you can download the get-pip.py script from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py. Save it to a directory, navigate to that directory in the command prompt, and run `python get-pip.py`.

Run the following command to install the Pillow library:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```


4. Execute the program:

```
python ascii_converter.py image_path.jpg
```


Replace `image_path.jpg` with the actual path to your image file. The program will resize the image and generate the corresponding ASCII art.

5. Console output:

The generated ASCII art will be displayed in the console.

6. Saving ASCII art to a file (optional):

During the program execution, you will be prompted if you want to save the ASCII art to a file. If you choose to save it, provide a file name when prompted, and the ASCII art will be saved to that file.
